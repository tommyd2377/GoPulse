    <h4>Sense making for the 21st century</h4>

    <p>
      For anyone interested in making sense of the world by having honest conversations related to current events,
      GoPulse is a social news platform that was built from the ground up to help users discover, share and
      discuss news sourced from well known publishers. GoPulse generates its 
      revenue from a small monthly subscription and because publishers are currated and articles on the platform are user-driven, 
      rather than user-generated, problems related to fake news, bots, disinformation campaigns, deepfakes, etc. are essentially 
      eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although articles on the platform can be counted on to be factually correct, the mainstream news media is becoming 
      increasingly prone to narrative driven journalism, where the facts of an article are technically correct but the story 
      is molded to fit a predetermined narrative based on the publications political philosophy.
      It is up to the GoPulse community to call out political bias, misleading headlines, sensationalism, 
      clickbait and articles that just don't make sense. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Intellectual honesty is of the utmost importance when posting in the comments section.
      When disagreements inevitably occur, work through the argument from the other side first so if you finally conclude 
      that you are in fact correct, you will be able to make a clear and concise refute to any likely counter argument. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      If we all strive for respectful communication that's based on getting to the truth on any given subject,
      this social community can be used as a starting point to create a world of good faith arguments and honest 
      dialogue related to the changing global landscape.
    </p>

    <h1>Features</h1>

    <p>
      GoPulse has a familiar user experience and most users should be comfortable navigating through the app.
      However, the platform does have some unique design features that may require a little explaination.
    </p>

    <h4>GoCodes</h4>

    <p>
      GoPulse is a unique social platform because it has a very low "minumum effective network", this means that subscribers do not need a large 
      number of followers/followees to get a lot out of the service. The idea is to have high quality subscribers to keep comments and discussions
      as high quality as possible. 
    </p>

    <h4>Reading and Sharing</h4>

    <p>
      Subscribers may have noticed that sharing of any kind is only possible after having read the article. This is of course to 
      mitigate the spread of misinformation as much as possible. Headlines can of course be misleading, but more importantly the actual
      facts of an article can be buried paragraphs down from the headline and without knowing the full context you are more likely to spread
      information that is overly simplistic and lacks any nuance, or even worse information that is actually wrong.
    </p>

    <h4>Flagging</h4>

    <p>
      If you have read an article and feel that it has a misleading headline, is politically biased, sensationalist or contains factually 
      incorrect information it is your responsibility as a subscriber on this platform to flag it as narrative driven journalism
      for your followers to see and discuss.
    </p>

    <h4>Direct Send</h4>

    <p>
      If you read an article that you want to share with a specific follower rather than all your followers, you can send an article directly to them
      that will only be visible in their private feed.
